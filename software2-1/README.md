Andrej Karpathy Coined Software 2.0 [here](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) as Coding using Machine Learning where the machine learns what it needs to solve a problem, 
but sometimes some problems require both Machine Learning solutions mixed with Coding solutions. This I call software 2.1.
