Use at your own Risk!


Basic concept is to combine webSerial [here](https://hpssjellis.github.io/my-examples-of-arduino-webUSB-webSerial/public/webserial-and-polyfill.html)
with EdgeIMpulse WASM coding [here](https://hpssjellis.github.io/my-examples-of-edge-impulse/public/index.html) with a downloads index.html 
file [here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-of-edge-impulse/tree/main/public/downloads) eventually this index.html should work for both vision classification and FOMO.
