# maker101

A more in depth look at Machine Learning for High School students or General University Undergrads who have completed [Maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100)


So far we have possible curriculum to pick: Slides, Videos, Instructions and COLABS from:

1.  EdX by tinyMLx  at [https://github.com/tinyMLx/courseware](https://github.com/tinyMLx/courseware)    
2.  EdgeImpulse University at [[EdgeImpulse University](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/university)](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/university)


Since these university tsyle courses should be platform, IDE, framework and hardware independent I will put the course work in relevant folders or links:

Arduino-Portenta

Arduino-ML-Kit using the Nano33Ble [here](https://github.com/tinyMLx/arduino-library) at the tinyMLx github
