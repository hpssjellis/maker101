# Maker101

A more in depth look at Machine Learning for High School students or General University Undergrads who have completed [Maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100)


So far we have possible curriculum to pick: Slides, Videos, Instructions and COLABS from:

1.  [tinyMLx](https://github.com/tinyMLx/courseware)   EDx course work [here](https://github.com/tinyMLx/courseware/tree/master/edX)  
2.  [EdgeImpulse University](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/university) course work [here](https://github.com/edgeimpulse/courseware-embedded-machine-learning)
3.  ...
4.  ...


Since these university courses should be: platform, IDE, framework and hardware independent I will put the course work in relevant folders or links:

[Arduino-Portenta](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker101/tree/main/arduino-portenta) This course uses C/C++ programming language and the old Arduino IDE (Could use Platform.io, the new Arduino IDE version 2.x or the Arduino Cloud Editor)

Arduino-ML-Kit using the Nano33Ble C/C++ link [here](https://github.com/tinyMLx/arduino-library) at the tinyMLx github
